<h2 style="font-family:impact;"><em>Background</em></h2>
<dir>
<p>I’m Sierra. When I’m not at college I live in a town called Montrose. It is about and hour and 15 minutes north of the school. On campus, I live in Hoyt Hall.
</p>
<br>

<p>I recently changed my major from SAG to Computer Science with a minor in History. Over spring break I will be studying abroad in Dublin, Ireland and London, England studying art history. I currently work as a Night Watch Person in the towers. </p>

<h2 style="font-family:impact;"><em>Interests &#38; Hobbies</em></h2>
<dir>
<p>
My interest range from basically anything that I can make. </p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Cosplay: I like to make costumes and wear them to conventions like Comic Con type things with my friends. A few of my favorite cosplays i've done are Ruby Rose from <a href="http://roosterteeth.com/show/rwby">RWBY</a>, a Tunnel Snake from Fallout, and Tashigi from One Piece. </li>
<li>Knitting, crochet, prop making, chain mail, and jewelry making are just a few of the other crafts I do. I am currently working on making a small baby elephant using a crochet method called amigurumi.</li>
<li>Outside of crafts I like to play all different kinds of games from Dungeons and Dragons to board games, to video games. My favorite game right now is Overwatch. </li>
<li>I like reading comics too. My favorites are SAGA, Lumberjanes, Captain Marvel, Check Please!, and <a href="http://www.paranatural.net">Paranatural</a>.</li>
<li>I like watching anime as well, I really like Boku no Hero, One Punch Man, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, Tanaka-kun is Always so Listless, and One Piece.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font-family:impact;"><em>Goals </em></h2>
<dir>
<p>As far as my goals, I’m going to talk about career and academic first. I would like to graduate as close to on time as possible and maybe get a job at the Google office in Ann Arbor. If I like it there, and I like the time I spend in Dublin I’m hoping to transfer to their Dublin office. If neither of those things pan out I would like to work somewhere in the video game industry, at places like Bioware, Bethesda or Blizzard.</p>
<br><br>
<p>As far as personal goals, I would like to move somewhere warmer. While I like snow and the way it looks, I don’t really work too well with the cold. I don’t see the need to get a full big house if I’m living by myself so I was hoping to get some kind of big, nice apartment or maybe some kind of condo. I’d also like to have a few pets. For suren I would have a cat but I might also get a few birds or lizards.
